TypeScript, ESLint & Prettier Setup

TypeScript

- `tsconfig.json` has `strict: true`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` to catch bugs at compile time.

ESLint + Prettier

- `.eslintrc.json` extends `next/core-web-vitals`, `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`, `plugin:prettier/recommended`.
- Rules: `no-console: warn`, `semi: ["error","always"]`, `quotes: ["error","double"]`.

Pre-commit Hooks

- Husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` on staged files to ensure code quality before commit.

Why

- Strict TypeScript reduces runtime bugs by enforcing types during development.
- ESLint enforces consistent code style and catches common errors early.
- Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental bad code being committed to the repo.

Environment Variable Management

Files Created:

.env.local → stores real credentials like DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, and API_KEY (not pushed to GitHub).
.env.example → sample file with placeholder values for setup reference.
.gitignore → includes .env.local to protect secrets from being committed.

Variables Used

Server-side Variables:
DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, API_KEY — accessible only in the backend and never exposed to the client.

Client-side Variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL — safe to expose to the frontend and used for public API calls.

Safe Usage Example:

// Backend only
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;

// Frontend safe variable
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL;

Why Environment Variables Matter:

Keeps sensitive data secure and out of source control.
Maintains clean configuration for all environments (development, staging, production)
Prevents accidental exposure of API keys or database URLs.
Ensures easy onboarding using .env.example as a reference file.
Build-time vs Runtime

In Next.js, environment variables are loaded at build time.
This means if you modify .env.local, you must restart the development server to apply changes.
Client-side variables (those starting with NEXT*PUBLIC*) are bundled during the build and can be safely accessed in browser code.

Reflection

If a teammate accidentally pushed .env.local to GitHub, all sensitive credentials — like database URLs or API keys — would become public.
My setup prevents this by:
Adding .env.local to .gitignore (so it never gets committed).
Providing .env.example with safe placeholder values for teammates to replicate their setup securely.
